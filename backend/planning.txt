    ON SERVER CONNECTION
        - Establish websocket connection (/)

    1. Player create a room in the namespace:
    - expects: name, maxPlayers, playerSocketId 
        - On "create-room" event:
            - Initialize Player based on their socket 
            - Create logical GameRoom 
            - Create a network room
            - Join current player to network room
            - Add them to GameRoom currentPlayer
            - Add GameRoom to game.rooms

    2. Players join created room:
    - expects: roomId, playerSocketId
        - On "join-room" event:
            If exists room id in rooms
            If room is not full
            If room hasnt started
                - Join them to network room
                - Add them to GameRoom currentPlayer
            Else
                Dont connect and emit error

    3. Players leave created room:
    - expects: roomId, playerSocketId
        - On "leave-room" or "disconnect" events:
            - Disconnect them from network room
            - Remove them from currentPlayers

    THIS IS TO BE ADDED AS CHECK
    4. If theres no Player in a room
        - Remove network room
        - Remove empty room
